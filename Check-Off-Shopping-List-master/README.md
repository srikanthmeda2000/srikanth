# Check-Off-Shopping-List
In this assignment we are going to implement check of shopping list using angular js. The idea of this assignment is to create a "check off" shopping List application.  Think of being in a store with a shopping list that allows you to "check off" the items you've already bought, except instead of checking them off, the bought item simply moves to the "Already Bought" list. It display to the user two lists one for proposed items to buy and other already bought items. Next to each item in the "to buy" list there is a button with the label "Bought". When the user clicks on the "Bought" button, its associated item should be removed from the "To Buy" list and appear in the "Already Bought" list.  The "Already Bought" list should initially be empty and display a message "Nothing bought yet". Once the user "buys" every item on the "To Buy" list, Instead of the empty "To Buy" list, display the message "Everything is bought!".
